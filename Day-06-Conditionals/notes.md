# Day 06: Python Conditionals
Conditionals help you control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.

## Summary
- Use `if` for single checks.
- Use `if-else` for binary logic.
- Use `if-elif-else` for multiple branches.
- Use nested `if` when conditions depend on previous checks.
- Use ternary for short conditional assignments.
