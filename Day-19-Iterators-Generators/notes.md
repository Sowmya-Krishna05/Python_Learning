# Day 19: Iterators and Generators

## âœ… Iterators:
- Objects that implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()`
- Can be created manually or with custom classes

## âœ… Generators:
- Use `yield` to return values one at a time
- More memory-efficient and readable

## âœ… Generator Expressions:
- Like list comprehensions but with round brackets `()`
- Useful for lazy evaluation

## ðŸ†š Generator vs Iterator:
- Generators are iterators, but easier to write
- Iterators give you more control but are verbose

## âš¡ Use Case:
- Reading large files
- Streaming data
- Lazy loading
